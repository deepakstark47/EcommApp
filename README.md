This Food Ordering System project is a full-stack application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. 🍔💻

The backend, written in Java, utilizes the Spring Boot framework and is managed with Maven. The main source code is located under the src/main/java/com/zosh directory, and configuration files are in src/main/resources. The compiled files are stored in the target directory. 🚀

The frontend, developed with React, is structured with the source code in the src directory, static files in public, and dependencies in node_modules, managed by npm or yarn. 🎨

To get started, ensure you have Java 8+, Maven, Node.js 14+, and npm or yarn installed. ⚙️

For the backend, navigate to the Source/backend-spring-boot directory, install dependencies with mvn clean install, and run the application using mvn spring-boot:run. The API will be available at http://localhost:8080. 🌐

For the frontend, move to the Source/frontend-react directory, install dependencies with npm install or yarn install, and start the React application with npm start or yarn start. The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. 🌍

The project features user management for registration, login, and profile management; restaurant management for admins; order management for users and admins; and a review system for restaurant feedback. 🛠️
